<h2 id="behavioral-box-design">Behavioral box design</h2>
<p>Current protocol is performed with the use of in-house manufactured behavioral box system, which consists of multiple components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plexiglas chamber with a metal bar floor and a slit in the front wall, housing the mouse during the experiment;</li>
  <li>Motorized feeder system for precisely delivering and positioning single pellets (5-10 mg Sucrose Tap Pellets, TestDiet) in front of the slit;</li>
  <li>Arduino-based controller autonomously performing the programmed experimental protocol (written in C++), interfacing with the touch sensors in the box and providing the master clock signal;</li>
  <li>Single FLIR 1.6MP High-Speed camera (Model: Blackfly S BFS-U3-16S2M) with a system of mirrors, saving the video stream on the computer with the use of a Python interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, there are <strong>4 main components that you will need</strong> to assemble the behavioral box:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plexiglas sheets cut to size and drilled</li>
  <li>3d printed parts for the box such as corners holding the sheets together,</li>
  <li>3d printed feeder and Arduino components</li>
  <li>Small screws and nuts kit to put everything together and metal rods for the floor (can be ordered from Amazon)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of them can be purchased or manufactured in house with the use of 3d printer and CNC machines or just ordered online.</p>

<p><em>.stl</em> files for printing the components are provided in <a href="https://github.com/BerezhnoyD/Reaching_Task_VAI/tree/main/ReachingBox_3D_Model">this folder</a> of the repository. 
Dimensions for the parts and schematics is provided in <a href="https://github.com/BerezhnoyD/Reaching_Task_VAI/tree/main/ArticleSupplements">supplementary materials</a> of the repository and <a href="https://star-protocols.cell.com/protocols/3539">the article</a>.
Computer-aided design (CAD) software along with CNC cutter machine can be used to scale and speed up the manufacturing process 
(all the design files provided were made using <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a> software), but the original design can be easily reproduced without it using only all-manual tools.</p>
