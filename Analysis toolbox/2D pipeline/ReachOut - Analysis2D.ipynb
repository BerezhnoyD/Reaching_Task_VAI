It will open the GUI to review the 2d trajectory with time used as a 3rd dimension and extract the fragments of the trajectory for further analysis. In cotrast to the standard pipeline this one uses different script (tracking_split_2d), all other steps are the same, but with the time substituting Z-dimension.\n",
